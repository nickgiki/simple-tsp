# simple-tsp: A simple TSP solver using numpy and LNS

Welcome to simple-tsp, a highly efficient solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm. This project is for demonstration purposes, to show how complex optimization problems can be tackled in milliseconds with minimal code.

## Important
No Copilot/Cursor/GPT/Claude etc was used for creating the code in this project (although they will very soon scrape and have it ðŸ˜„)

## Features

- Solves TSP for 17 cities in just 700 milliseconds on my machine.
- Written in concise Python code (less than 80 lines).
- Demonstrates significant improvements over exhaustive search methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nickgiki/simple-tsp.git
   cd simple-tsp
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the solver with the following command:
```bash
python lns_tsp.py
```
